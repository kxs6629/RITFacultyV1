# Project 3 - Kenny Scott

## Description
This project is a .NET front-end application that utilizes the Model View Controller design method. This project consumes data from the [RIT API](http://www.ist.rit.edu/api/) and creates webpages based on the given information

## Above and Beyond
To go above and beyond the following was implemented:
* Included an extra call to the API that created another page for staff members
* Used the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) JQuery plugin to make the tables easier to read.
* Combined the Grad/Undergrad pages into one page to make navigation easier
* Moved faculty to a page separate from the index. About page replaced index
