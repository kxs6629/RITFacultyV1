# Project 3 - Kenny Scott

## Description
This project is a .NET application that utilizes the Model View Controller design method. This project consumes data from the [RIT API](http://www.ist.rit.edu/api/) and creates webpages based on the given information

## Above and Beyond
To go above and beyond, I included an extra call to the API that created another page for staff members. In addition to this, I also used the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) JQuery plugin to make the tables easier to read.
